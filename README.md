# Let's find which is existed evaluation done to builded my project based on the provided criteria:-

1. Code Logic and Cleanliness:
Structure & Readability:

Your project has well-structured code with a clear separation of components and styles. Ensure that:
Each component has a single responsibility.
Code is consistently indented and formatted.
Comments are added where complex logic exists or where the intent might not be immediately clear.
State Management:

Efficient state management is crucial. React hooks are used effectively for managing state. Make sure:
State updates are performant, especially in components that affect multiple parts of the app.
Proper cleanup is done to prevent memory leaks.
Comments:

Ensure comments are present and useful. They should explain why certain decisions were made, especially in complex areas of code or where there might be potential confusion.
2. Design Symmetry:
Consistent Layout:

The layout is consistent across pages. Check:
Uniform spacing, alignment, and styling for similar components.
Consistent design elements (buttons, headers, etc.).
Responsive Design:

CSS media queries are used to ensure responsiveness. Verify by:
Testing on various devices and screen resolutions.
Ensuring no elements are misaligned or improperly scaled on different devices.
Design Elements:

Design elements like buttons and images should be aligned and styled consistently. Confirm:
All design elements match the intended visual design.
No design discrepancies across different pages.
3. Reusable Components:
Component Reusability:

Components like ProductCard and CartItem are reusable. Ensure:
These components are used consistently throughout the application.
Similar code is not repeated elsewhere.
Modularity:

Components are modular. Check:
Changes to a component are reflected throughout the application.
Components are easy to update or replace without affecting the overall functionality.
4. Completeness of Features:
Feature Implementation:

All features (product display, cart management, checkout, confirmation) are implemented. Confirm:
All features work as expected.
Edge cases (e.g., empty cart, failed checkout) are handled gracefully.
Functionality:

Thoroughly test all functionalities. Ensure:
Adding products to the cart, updating quantities, checking out, and viewing the confirmation page all work correctly.
The application handles errors or invalid inputs properly, providing clear feedback to the user.
